# NHST-SECT
Shape-valued data are of interest in applied sciences. While some statistical estimators have been developed for analyzing shape-valued observations, current techniques for performing statistical inference on such observations are limited. In this paper, we introduce a smooth Euler characteristic transform-based randomization-style null hypothesis test to distinguish different collections of shapes. Our proposed method has a solid mathematical foundation and is computationally efficient. Simulation studies indicate that the performance of our hypothesis testing framework is satisfactory. The mandibular molars from four genera of primates are analyzed to demonstrate the applications of our proposed hypothesis testing approach to real data sets. Our proposed approach is expected to be applied to phylogenetics and bioimage informatics in future research.

Results in the manuscript were derived by using the R version of the code. Based on the structure of the manuscript, this repositories is divided into three parts:
